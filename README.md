# Generalized Influence Measurement

This repository contains accompanies the paper *Conductance and Social Capital: Modeling and Empirically Measuring Online Social Influence*, and contains the derived empirical influence ranking, and the implementation of the MTURK active learning setup.


### Structure
We provide the user ids `./01_raw/arson_user_ids.txt` and tweet ids `./01_raw/arson_tweet_ids.txt` for the arson dataset. Additionally, we provide the empirical social influence ranking in `./01_raw/arson_with_empirical_influence.csv`.

In the `./02_mturk/` folder we provide the implementation code for the active learning framework.
